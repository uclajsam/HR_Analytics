# Predicting Employee Churn

## Introduction
Employee turnover is a costly problem that many companies face today.  The actual cost for replacing an employe can be very significant.  According to a study conducted by the Center for American Progress, companies spend about 20% of an employees' salary to replace that individual.  The percentage can be significantly higher if a "key" employee or C-level executive needs to be replaced.  In addition to the monetary cost, substantial time is needed to replace that employee (i.e. interviewing potential candidates, onboarding, training, etc.).  Companies can spend a few weeks to a few months replacing employees, which can reduce a company's profitability and production.
